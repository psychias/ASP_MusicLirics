We're in the home stretch of the high times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Mmm-mmm, mmm
Call it dumb luck, but, baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up although we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it, but the
Wolves came and went and we're still standing
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good
Bones are good, the rest (baby, it don't really matter), the rest don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass (oh, the glass, oh, the glass) could shatter
Bones are good, the rest (ooh), the rest don't matter (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (yeah)
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break (let it break, let it break), 'cause you and I remain the same (woo-ooh-ooh, ooh)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (woo-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Yeah-eh-ey
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
