You're the one I just I'm just coming back to let you know I can never say it on the phone We'll never let you go this time I said Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey I said Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch Thanks for watching!
