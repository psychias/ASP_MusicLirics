 I'm going under and this time I feel there's no one to save me This all or nothing really got away, you're driving me crazy I need somebody to heal, somebody to know Somebody to have, somebody to hold It's easy to say, but it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you know I'm not the poet And all the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I lay up my gun down and then you pull the rug I was scared it kinda used to be and so were you left I'm going under and this time I feel there's no one to turn to This all or nothing way of loving, go be sleeping without you I need somebody to know, somebody to heal Somebody to have, just to know how it feels It's easy to say, but it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape And all the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I lay up my gun down and then you pull the rug I was scared it kinda used to be and so were you left And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts Sometimes I fall into your arms I'll be safe in your soul till I go back around And all the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I lay up my gun down and then you pull the rug I was scared it kinda used to be and so were you left But now the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I lay up my gun down and then you pull the rug I was scared it kinda used to be and so were you left I lay up my gun down and then you pull the rug I was scared it kinda used to be and so were you left
