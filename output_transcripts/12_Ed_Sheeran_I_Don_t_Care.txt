 I'm at a party I don't wanna be at And I don't ever wear a suit and tie I'm wondering if I can sneak out the back Nobody's even looking me in my eyes Can you take my hand, finish my drink, say shall we dance? Hell yeah, you know I love you, did I ever tell you? You make it better like that Don't think I fit in at this party Everyone's got so much to say I always feel like I'm nobody Who wants to fit in anyway? Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby All the bad things disappear Are you making me feel that maybe I am somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby Cause I don't care as long as you're just holding it You can take me anywhere Are you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby We at a party we don't wanna be at Tryna talk but we can't hear ourselves Speechless, I'd rather kiss him right back But all these people all around are crippled with anxiety But I'm told it's where it's supposed to be You know what, it's kinda crazy cause I really don't mind Can you make it better like that Don't think we fit in at this party Everyone's got so much to say When we walked in I said I'm sorry But now I think that we should stay Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby All the bad things disappear Are you making me feel that maybe I am somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby Cause I don't care as long as you're just holding it You can take me anywhere Are you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby I don't like nobody but it looks like you're the only one here I don't like nobody but it, baby I don't care I don't like nobody but you I hate everyone here I don't like nobody but you, baby Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby All the bad things disappear Are you making me feel that maybe I am somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby Cause I don't care as long as you're just holding it You can take me anywhere Are you making me feel like I'm loved by somebody? I can deal with the bad nights When I'm with my baby
