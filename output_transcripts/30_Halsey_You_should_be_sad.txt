 I wanna start this out and say I gotta get it off my chest Got no anger, got no malice Just a little bit of regret Know nobody else will tell you So there's some things I gotta say Gonna jot it down and then get it out And then I'll be on my way Know you're not half the man you think that you are And you can't fill the hole inside of you With money, drugs and cars I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you Oh I feel so sorry, I feel so sad I tried to help you It just ain't too bad And I had no warning About who you are I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down And then ran so fucking far that you would never ever touch me again Won't see your alligator tears cause no I've had enough of them Gonna start this out by saying I really meant well from the start Take a broken man right in my hands And then put back all his parts But you're not half the man you think that you are And you can't fill the hole inside of you With money, girls and cars I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you Oh I feel so sorry, I feel so sad I tried to help you It just ain't too bad And I had no warning About who you are I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down Oh I feel so sorry, I feel so sad I tried to help you It just ain't too bad And I had no warning About who you are About who you are Ay ay ay ay ay ay Ay ay ay ay ay Cause you're not half the man you think that you are And you can't fill the hole inside of you With money, drugs and cars I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you I feel so sad, you should be sad You should be, you should be sad You should be, you should be You should be
