 You promised the world and I fell for it I put you first and you adored it Set fires to my forest and you let it burn Sang off key in my chorus Cause it wasn't yours I saw the signs and I ignored it Rose colored glasses are distorted Set fire to my purpose and I let it burn You got off in the herd and when it wasn't yours, yeah We'd always go into it blindly I needed to lose you to find me This dance that was killing me softly I needed to hate you to love me, yeah To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to lose you to love me, yeah To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to lose you to love me I gave my all and they all know it You turned me down and now it's showing And told them all to replace us Like it was easy Made me think I deserved it And the thick of healing, yeah We'd always go into it blindly I needed to lose you to find me This dance that was killing me softly I needed to hate you to love me, yeah To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to lose you to love me, yeah To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to lose you to love me You promised the world and I fell for it I put you first and you adored it Surfer's to my forest And you let it burn Sing off key in my chorus To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to hate you to love me, yeah To love, love you To love, love you To love you I needed to lose you to love me To love, love you To love, love you To love you And now the chapter is closed and done To love, love you To love, love you To love you And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
