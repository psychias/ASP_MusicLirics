 We're in the homestretch of the hard times We took a hard left, but we're alright Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it But we built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it When the bones are good, the rest don't matter Yeah, the pain could peel, the glass could shatter Let it rain, cause you and I remain the same When there ain't a crack in the foundation Baby, I know when it's gone we're pissing the car right over while we stay But the house don't fall when the bones are good Call it dumb luck, but baby you and I can't even mess it up Though we both tried, no it don't always go the way we planned it But the wolves came and went and we're still standing When the bones are good, the rest don't matter Yeah, the pain could peel, the glass could shatter Let it rain, cause you and I remain the same When there ain't a crack in the foundation Baby, I know when it's gone we're pissing the car right over while we stay But the house don't fall when the bones are good When the bones are good When the bones are good, the rest don't matter The rest don't matter, the pain could peel, the glass could shatter When the bones are good, the rest don't matter The rest don't matter, the pain could peel, the glass could shatter Let it rain, cause you and I remain the same When there ain't a crack in the foundation Baby, I know when it's gone we're pissing the car right over while we stay But the house don't fall when the bones are good
