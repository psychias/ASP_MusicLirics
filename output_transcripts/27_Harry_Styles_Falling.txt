 I'm in my bed, and you're not here And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands Forget what I said, it's not what I meant And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage left What am I now, what am I now? What if I'm someone I don't want to run? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling What if I'm down, what if I'm out? What if I'm someone you won't talk about? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling You said you cared, and you missed me too And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you The coffee's out at the Beechwood Cafe And it kills me cause I know we've run out of things we can say What am I now, what am I now? What if I'm someone I don't want to run? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling What if I'm down, what if I'm out? What if I'm someone you won't talk about? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again What am I now, what am I now? What if you're someone I just want to run? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling What if I'm down, what if I'm out? What if I'm someone you won't talk about? I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling Thanks for watching!
