Hey homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean where do you hide?
Do people assume you're always alright?
Been so good at smiling most of your life

Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for you

But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let them all in on the lie
