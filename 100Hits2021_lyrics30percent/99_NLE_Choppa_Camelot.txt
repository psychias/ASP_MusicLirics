FreshDuzit
Yeah
Huh, huh, huh

I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shots
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil' nigga you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas

My niggas trappin' out the bando, shoutout to the Migos (The Migos)
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole
The trap always open, bitch, we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos

Step one, step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hunnid some' drums like a band in this bitch
