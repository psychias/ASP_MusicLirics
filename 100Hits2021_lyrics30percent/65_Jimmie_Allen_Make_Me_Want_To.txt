Long legs, cut off jeans
Pulling me in like a magnet
Your eyes locked on me
I knew right then I had to have you

Right here in the middle of the floor
Of this hole-in-the-wall on a back street
I knew I had to get close to you

Girl, what's your name? What you drinking?
Yeah, what's your favorite song?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gon' be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah, it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to
