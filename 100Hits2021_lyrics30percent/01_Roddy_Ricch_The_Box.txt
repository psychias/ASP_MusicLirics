Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mmh

Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?

I was out back, where the stash at?
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Niggas try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down on my son, or my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'

I done out my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
