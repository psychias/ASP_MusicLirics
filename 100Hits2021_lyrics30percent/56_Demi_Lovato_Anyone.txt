Uh, uh

I tried to talk to my piano
I tried to talk to my guitar
Talked to my imagination
Confided into alcohol

I tried and tried and tried some more
Told secrets 'til my voice was sore
Tired of empty conversation
'Cause no one hears me anymore

A hundred million stories
And a hundred million songs
I feel stupid when I sing
Nobody's listening to me
Nobody's listening

I talked to shooting stars
But they always get it wrong
I feel stupid when I pray
