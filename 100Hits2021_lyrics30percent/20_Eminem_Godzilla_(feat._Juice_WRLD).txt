Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The Brain" Heenan

Which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up, consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut, pass the Courvoisi'

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a play date
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames, they cannot tame or placate the

Monster, you get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal durin' the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all, and in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball, tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Risperdal, voices whisper, my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
