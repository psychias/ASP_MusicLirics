Ooh-wee
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you love fuckin' me
(Fuckin' me, fuckin' me)
I can tell by the way you in love with me (Love with me)
You can't get enough of me, yeah
Well, I guess it's lookin' like you stuck with me

'Cause I got you sprung off in the spring time
Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That dick make my soul smile
That dick make me so damn proud

Now lay your head down on the pillow
Turn the lights down real low
I want you to say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
