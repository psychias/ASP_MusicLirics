I saw you going by, I had to say hello
And I don't mean to pry, but girl, I gotta know
What is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (damn)
And I know we just met, but

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
