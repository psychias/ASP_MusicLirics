I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you around the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk a few things out
Before we hit the road

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
