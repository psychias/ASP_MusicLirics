Phew, phew, yeah
If you weigh me down then I gotta remove you
If you in my way, then I gotta go through you (Don, Don)
Look, look, look, funeral

I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it (Huh)
They say, "All facts," but don't prove shit (Huh)
You in my way, need to move, bitch (Huh)
Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Huh)
This a win-win, swear I'm so choosy
Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship

I don't really sleep or take naps, no snoozin'
All these burners here hot, but we coolin'
I was playin' dumb, they was thinkin' I'm stupid
My accountant just called, said, shit been movin'
I'm 'posed to have no gun, I got two of 'em
I never remind a nigga what I do for 'em
I was dead broke, sleep on the futon
Now I'm up, now I'm big house, few of 'em
Everyday I'm lit, my life like a re-run
If I take your shit, can't give you no refund

Ten mil' for a deal I agree on
I put on for Atlanta like Deion
Chrome Heart glasses, I can't see 'em
From the apartments to an arena
Where that 'lil boy been? I ain't seen him
Look at God's child drivin' the Demon
Fuck what you heard
