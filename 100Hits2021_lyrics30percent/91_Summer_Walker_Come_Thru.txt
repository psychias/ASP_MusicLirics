We got London on da Track
I should've known better
Can't even pretend like I don't want it again
On the brain all the time
Thinkin' of all the things that we did
You did something
'Cause shit like this don't happen too often
It's the way you put it down
I don't want no one else around

Got me takin' a step on the wild side
Cuttin' all ties
With them other guys
Way you, way you look in my eyes
Lovin' me nice and slow

You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
