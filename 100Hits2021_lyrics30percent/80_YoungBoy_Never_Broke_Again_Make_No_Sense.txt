Buddah Blessed This Beat

I feel like I'm Gucci Mane in 2006
All these diamonds dancing on my fucking neck cost like four bricks
And the way that I be toting on that strap don't make no sense
He a million dollar nigga, but be posted in the bricks, ayy

It make no sense, yeah-yeah, it make no sense, uh
It make no sense, God, damn
Make no sense, yeah, make no sense, nah-uh
Make no sense, ayy, YoungBoy
Make no sense, nah, it make no sense, slime

I could hit it, I could whip it
I could bag it, I could stash it
I could trap out like a motherfucker
And you know me, bitch, I just bought another .30 burner (.30 burner)
I whip too hard, so I got Ike and Meech, got Tina Turner (whipping hard)
It don't make sense, I'm not alright, bitch, I'll put you under
I ain't cut too much, I got that shit that make 'em tweak like "damn"
