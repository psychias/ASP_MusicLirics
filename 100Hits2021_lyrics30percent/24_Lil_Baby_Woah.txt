New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm comin'
You know how I'm comin'

Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, what's happenin'?
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons

My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagons
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty

Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
