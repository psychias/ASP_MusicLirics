Yeah
I just left your viewing at the Staples Center (I did)
Obama wrote you a letter, yeah, you made it nigga (You made it)
I even heard you had some players to come to Vegas with us
And them suckers could never kill you, it only made you bigger (Yeah)

And every time I see some fire I see blue
And every time I close my eyes, see Snupe and I see you
When I be on the West side (West side), you know how we do (How we do)
Hustle and motivate, turning one into a two (Two, two), two into four
Hurt my heart, I seen you on the floor, do it for the hood

And I don't even wanna do it no more
When these niggas you do it for, they'll shoot you and all
The only thing I can say is you with the Lord, blessings (Blessings)
And I ain't finna say it like I'm your main homie (I won't)
But when we lost you it really put some pain on me (It did)

Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me (Brrt)
And when them niggas went against me
You ain't change on me (You ain't change on me)
Told me it was wrong or righ,t some of my longest nights (You do)
You made me cry nigga (Cry nigga), and I don't cry nigga (Cry nigga)
