We used to chase that Chattanooga fray
Couple a kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple lamp
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then

Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town

Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
