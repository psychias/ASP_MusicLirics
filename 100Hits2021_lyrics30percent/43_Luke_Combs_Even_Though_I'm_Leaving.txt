Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed, he grabbed my hand and said

"Just 'cause I'm leaving, it don't mean that
I won't be right by your side
When you need me and you can't see me
In the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leaving, I ain't going nowhere"
