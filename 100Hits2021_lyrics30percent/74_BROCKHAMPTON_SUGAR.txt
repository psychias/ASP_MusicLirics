Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for

Tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Change your mind when I change my life
Better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God
So we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compel

You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feelin' brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Tear my temple down into a prison, shit

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
