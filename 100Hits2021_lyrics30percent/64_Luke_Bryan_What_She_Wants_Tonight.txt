She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone

If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said, she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of kentucky dry

Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
