Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me, too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

That college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me, too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
