She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you looking from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name

She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearing less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
And push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

He got that mmm, green eyes, giving me signs
That he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you looking from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay

Ven para acá quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mi, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
