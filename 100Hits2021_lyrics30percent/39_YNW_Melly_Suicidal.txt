Suicidal
Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal

I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal

Sipping on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
