It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said I don't love you
A little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a good-bye

Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find, what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you keep moving on
