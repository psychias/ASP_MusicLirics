I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby how you feeling? (Feeling good as hell)

Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
