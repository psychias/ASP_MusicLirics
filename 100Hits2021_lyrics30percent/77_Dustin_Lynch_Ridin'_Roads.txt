Ridin' roads
Ridin' roads

Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
30, early out there in your drive

Got you a Bullet and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
This 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
