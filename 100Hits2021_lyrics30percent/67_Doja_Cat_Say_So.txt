Day to night to morning
Keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it
Why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice
No punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused
You want it? Say so

Day to night to morning
Keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it
Why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice
No punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused
You want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you (fell in love)
You ain't coming out your shell
You ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
