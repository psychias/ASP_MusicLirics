Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on earth
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
I'm not feelin' up, baby, I let him gas me (Yeah)

Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap, I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak

I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace
Head got me wobblin'
