We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But, no, I ain't too proud

I couldn't be there
Even when I tried
You don't believe it
We do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
