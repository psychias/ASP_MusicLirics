Dancin' in the kitchen
You singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch
Just laughing at the dogs
Now you swear you love me more
When you're whispering goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

I'm homesick
This feeling that I'm feeling
No, we don't quit
It's like half of me is missing
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do

Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
