I wasn't trying to feel like this
I wasn't trying to feel nothing at all
I just came to meet my friends
And trying to drink the long week off
I didn't wanna stay too late
I wasn't trying to close it down
I was doing my own thing
Yeah up until you sat down

I thought that I catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me trying to
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl you got me trying to catch my breath
