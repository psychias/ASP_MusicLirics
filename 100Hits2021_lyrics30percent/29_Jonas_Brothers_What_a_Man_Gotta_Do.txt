Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason, I'm yours
I'm yours
I'd move the Earth or lose a fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours
All yours

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Good night" and your first "Good day"

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
