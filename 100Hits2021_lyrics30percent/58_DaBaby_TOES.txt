My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie

I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
What I look like with all them twenties? (Huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (Yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (Bling)
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (Yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (Woah, Kenny)

Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I can still go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that hoe

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
