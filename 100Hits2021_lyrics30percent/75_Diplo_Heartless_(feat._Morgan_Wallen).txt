Heartless (Heartless, heartless)
So heartless (So heartless, so heartless)

Say you're going out late
I count down 'til you call me
It's just one of those things
That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same

But I know I'm gonna let you win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell and you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself

But, why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finished what we started
Girl why you gotta be so heartless?
(So heartless, so heartless)
Why you gotta be so heartless?
