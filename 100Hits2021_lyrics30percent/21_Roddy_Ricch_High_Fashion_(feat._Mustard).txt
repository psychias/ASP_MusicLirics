Mustard on the beat, hoe

Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion, like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ah-ah, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red on the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae

She want Chane'-ne', Dio'-o'
I'm only doin' cash, I don't need promo
I pull up to the high rise, I'm in the four-four
Inside cocoa
If I got a feeling, I keep it inside my heart
And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
