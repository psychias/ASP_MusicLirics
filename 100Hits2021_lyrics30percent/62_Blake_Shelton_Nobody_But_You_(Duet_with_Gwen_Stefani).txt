Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to

Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me

I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
