We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it
But we built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good, mmm

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, though we both tried
