Same old dive, same old end of the work week drink
Bartender knows my name, but I don't mind
She kicks 'em up strong, serves me up right

And here I go again
I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox, lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

Another girl, another dance to a country song
