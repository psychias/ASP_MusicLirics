Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn't Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king

Friday night was living for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can't change
I'll always be the man that home made

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Yeah, homemade

Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
