Tay Keith, this too hard (Tay Keith, this too hard)

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

I don't got a heart, but fuck it I'm paid
Lil' A-B the body, he fresh out the cage
I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
They do what I say, they tryna get saved
They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
I told her get right, start acting your age, can't believe you tried it

Bitch, you played
Wanted a diamond choker, soon as our time was over
Bitch, you played
She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer
Bitch, you crazy
She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin'
Bitch, you played
She must've thought I was stupid
I knew she was fuckin' my cousin

I don't got a cold, I'm sipping on Hi-Tech
The Dusse, the yellow, I'm straight out the project
The first nigga play with me, he got shot at
A hunnid some shots flipped the car, that's a car wreck
I really don't need to be speaking on it
But fuck it, you know how it be when I get (what)
High off the motherfucking medicals (up there)
Get in the booth, and go federal (federal)
