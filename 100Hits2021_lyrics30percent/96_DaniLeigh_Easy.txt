Yeah, yeah

Let me catch a vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind, and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy

Damn, we so fire, babe
We been through the 305 highway
Love it how you ride in the fast lane
Make me wanna say, "That's my bae" (Yeah)

Dani gotta behave, gotta be chill like a Sunday
Never wanna look too thirsty
But your drip got me feeling wavy

Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
