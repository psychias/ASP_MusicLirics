I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing

Wish kids still learned to say "sir" and "ma'am", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

I wish everybody knew all the words to "Mama Tried"
I wish Monday mornin's felt just like Friday nights

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky-tonks didn't have no closin' time
