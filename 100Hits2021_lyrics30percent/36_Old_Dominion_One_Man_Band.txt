Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing a harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No base, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
