Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you're gettin' me
Ooh, out of this world, hands on, baby, now you're seeing me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you're gettin' me

Ha-ha-ha, you're gettin' me
Ha-ha-ha, you're gettin' me

See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
