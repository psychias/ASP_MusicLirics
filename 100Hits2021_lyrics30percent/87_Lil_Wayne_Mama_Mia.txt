What's good, brother?
Beat 'round the bush and I'ma come around
With a bush cutter and look for you
You niggas talkin' too much shit
I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like "Bang, bang, bang, bang"
'Til your heart stop drummin'

I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this motherfucker like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball

Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9'
But I'm still starvin' like a
Skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga

Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid

I'm out of my coofin, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
