Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Wooh

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling-bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career, just a little
You're supposed to hold me down
But you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom-bom-bi-dom, bi-dum-bum-bay
