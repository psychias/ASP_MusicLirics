Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual

Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr

Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them

We been to quite a few of 'em

The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds

Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
