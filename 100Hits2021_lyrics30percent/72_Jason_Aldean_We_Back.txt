Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll t-shirt headed to work
With a pack of red man in his pocket
He's kind of red man, but he's rockin'
Where's the beat up tele and the marshal stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six-pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days
Straight up gettin' sideways

We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my momma said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-Team, train on the track
Thought we were gone, but you wrong, now it's on, we back

Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
