I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring-cleaning
I'm always too busy dreaming
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget

Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Well, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing

Get everything I need then I'm gone
But it ain't stealing, can I get a break?
I wish that I could just, get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today

Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about
