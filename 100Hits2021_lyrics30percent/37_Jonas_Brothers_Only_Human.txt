Yeah, ayy

I don't want this night to end
It's closing time, so leave with me again (yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins

We gon' dance in my living room
Slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy)
Just dance in the living room
Love with an attitude
Drunk to an '80s groove (ayy)

We gon' dance in my living room
Slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy-ayy)
Dance in the living room
Love with an attitude
Drunk

It's only human, you know that it's real
