Yeah

I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hunnid and fifty
I be feeling like I'm drowning with it (drowning with it)
He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny yeah, yeah

500K that's just on the Richie
You don't wanna play on my city
Die everyday in my city
Whole lotta young, wild -
He be trying to ride the wave
You should be afraid that you might drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every - with me wearing Amiri

Headshot like POW
