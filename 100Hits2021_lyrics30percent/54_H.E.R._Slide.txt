You always wearin' them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucka look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Oh that shit attractive
I fuck with you girl

All you wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way

Only keep the fam' around me
So lemme know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"

We up till six in the mornin'
When the sunrise'll be on it
Know I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' stop

Everywhere we go, slide, hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we goin'
Slide, slide, slide, oh yeah, slide, oh
