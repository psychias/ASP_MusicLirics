Dreams, dreams, dreams

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up (as I'm lookin' up)
Suddenly, the sky erupts (sky erupts)
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I've been havin' dreams
