Man, like, you know (Ever since Baby on Baby dropped)
Ain't nobody drop shit (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country

Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you
Hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money (Let's go)

As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
