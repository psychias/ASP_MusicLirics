You do, you do
You do, you do

She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every weekend, shoulda seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil' mama gettin' it in all on her worst day
Lil mama gettin' it in
She fit the school and the gym into her workday

I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I'm all in the bed, she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me baby, it's for the night
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right

I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me

I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me
Wait, lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
