They say he likes a good time
(My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight
(Every night)
My momma doesn't trust him
(My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

A little bit older
A black leather jacket
A bad reputation
Insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe
Yeah, I said if you kiss me
I might let it happen

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl
Tonight I don't wanna be her

They say he likes a good time
(My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight
(Every night)
My momma doesn't trust him
