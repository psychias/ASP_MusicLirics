Oh Lord, Jetson made another one

I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got 33, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin' my sweats with Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds Offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me

Got some hood niggas postin' in the Le Jardin
I have this nigga on back of a carton
Spend Larry Bird, 33 on Cartier
I got 33 bitches with me
I'ma float through the city sippin' on some chardonnay
Fuck it, I am buying out the bar today
Fuck it, I'm buying out Barney's, yay
I'ma hang with the gangbangers
He only hang with the feds and the rats and the mice
If my young nigga pull up with the bullets
I'ma pull up with the strap, we gon' get him on sight
We gon' make a thriller like Mike
Car candy painted, Mike and Ike
And my diamonds lookin' like a light
I'ma fly a private like a kite
