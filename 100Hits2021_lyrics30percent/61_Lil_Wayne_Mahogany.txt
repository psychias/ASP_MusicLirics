Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down

Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now

In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
