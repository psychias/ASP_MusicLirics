You know lil' Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire
Now, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber
But I got a raw bitch
Know this money right here but you prolly wan' be me
But, bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Oversea got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in apartments

Business man when they got me in office
Million dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Spark Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with them chopsticks
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sisters, my mommas
Now they houses is as big as they want 'em
How they ran up them muhfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique

Livin' like we in a race
I might come in first and second but I won't never be last
Lately I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
They give you a inch, gonna take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself, like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Man, I reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd

Lambo so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and then everyone followed
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room
Sorry, I told 'em, "I can't"
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you
I run with no snakes
