Yo, sing this shit, are y'all fuckin' dumb?

(Eternal Atake)

Gotta shoot two at her (yeah)
Gotta shoot two at her (whoa)
Blue cheddar (yeah)
That girl, she got with my clone
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better (one, two, three, whoa)

Are you serious?
I swear my money is serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it
She sucked my dick 'til she get delirious (wow)
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it (woo)
Okay port, but I'm not talking New' (let's go)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, uh (damn)

I'm on some whole other shit
I got a whole 'nother rich, I'm on a new level
I was fuckin' on your bitch
She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't be two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches
I swear they all gonna snitch when my niggas gon' shoot at 'em
Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em

She saved my name in her phone
Only thing she saved me under is probably that "U" letter (hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got 50s on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (ha)
