Lights go down, wheels go 'round, I'm takin' ya home
Hopin' for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow is hittin' your eyes
Makin' me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

Slow dance with you
Spinnin' you 'round by the Walmart sign
And movin' our feet over the painted white lines
Gettin' close to you
Makin' the most of whatever we got
